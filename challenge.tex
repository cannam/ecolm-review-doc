% Software Sustainability Challenge submission should be no more than
% 2-pages long, and use the ACM sigconf template (for more details,
% see the main conference Call For Papers). They will be peer
% reviewed, and accepted submissions will be presented at the
% conference as either part of a panel or lightning talk and/or within
% a poster session (as determined by the Programme Chair). Challenge
% submissions will not be included in the main DLfM proceedings, but
% will be published on the conference website; they will additionally
% be used (with appropriate credit given) to inform a report into
% Digital Musicology for the UK Software Sustainability Institute.
%
% Challenge contributions must be submitted via the DLfM 2023
% EasyChair page by Friday 29 September.

  \section{Nature and purpose of the sustainable tool or resource}

  {\bf ECOLM} (1999-2002) was a project run by Tim Crawford which
  developed and populated a queryable database of lute tablature
  encodings with metadata using a web interface. Subsequent projects
  {\bf ECOLM II} (2002-2006) and {\bf ECOLM III} (2012) expanded the
  database and used it for some computational musicological
  investigations. The resulting database was hosted on a public-facing
  web server at Goldsmiths, University of
  London.\footnote{http://doc.gold.ac.uk/isms/ecolm/database/} It is
  still running today, although nobody is formally responsible for
  maintaining it.

  ECOLM is a relatively small scholarly resource with around 2,000
  carefully-curated encodings. A number of other public lute tablature
  resources exist, of variable size, quality, and consistency.
