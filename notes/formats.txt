RISM
====

RISM serves RDF/Turtle and JSON-LD through content-negotiation on URI:

$ curl -L -H "Accept: text/turtle" https://rism.online/sources/990015239
$ curl -L -H "Accept: application/ld+json" https://rism.online/sources/990015239

It also exposes MARCXML and RDF/XML through its OPAC web interface:

$ curl https://opac.rism.info/id/rismid/990015239?format=marc
$ curl https://opac.rism.info/id/rismid/990015239?format=rdf

The two are not the same! The rism.online interface uses rism.online
URIs for most things and expands some simple literals into entities.

e.g. a Turtle conversion of the OPAC RDF/XML gives relations like

<http://data.rism.info/id/rismid/990015239> dc:subject "Pavans"

while the rism.online Turtle has

<https://rism.online/sources/990015239> rism:hasSubject <https://rism.online/subjects/25423> .
<https://rism.online/subjects/25423> a rism:Subject ; rdfs:label "Pavans"@none ; rdf:value "Pavans" .
